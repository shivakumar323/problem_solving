// Finding majority element in an array(Moore's algorithm)

/*
Given an array of integers, find the majority element

The majority element is the element that appears more than n/2 times
where n is the size of an array

For example: 

Input: [3, 3, 2, 2, 3, 2, 3]
Output: 3

Input: [1, 1, 4, 1, 4, 4, 1, 4, 4]
Ouput: 4
